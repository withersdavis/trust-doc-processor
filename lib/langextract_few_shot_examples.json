The notarization requirement is a key detail to include.\r\nThe second path, the \"per stirpital\" share, is explained by summarizing that the money is \"set aside and divided\" for his descendants and placed into separate trusts for each person. This is the \"automatic\" option.\r\nThe section \"Disinterested Trustees May Confer Power\" describes a separate, special power that is distinct from the automatic distributions. This is summarized under a new, distinct heading.\r\nThe details of this special power are simplified: it's for independent trustees, it's about giving Jerry a power to pay creditors (except for tax debts), and it is for tax planning purposes to potentially save money.\r\nAll the original legal language is translated into clear, human-readable bullet points to make the complex legal concepts understandable.",
